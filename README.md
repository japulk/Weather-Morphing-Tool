# README

This is the read me file for the usage of weather morphing tool. This tool can be used to statistically down-scale the future daily and monthly climate change data from the Global Climate Models (GCMs) and Regional Climate Models (RCMs) simulation results. The supported variables at the time are:

- Outdoor temperature
- Global Horizontal Irradiance
- Wind speed

This tool is created in Matlab coding language and is free to be used and modified. The tool was created in University of Oulu and was created to be used in the following publications:

- Petri Hietaharju, Jari Pulkkinen, Mika Ruusunen, Jean-Nicolas Louis. A stochastic dynamic building stock model for determining long-term district heating demand under future climate change, Applied Energy, Volume 295, 2021, 116962, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.116962.

The calculation methods for the morphing are described in more detail in Pulkkinen & Louis (2021), but they are based on morphing methods created and used by:
